# SeCuton - Selenium Cucumber Skeleton

main

If you want to start as fast as possible with [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium) in combination with [Cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber) you are absolutely right here. Just clone this repo and start it. It contains executable minimalistic examples so you can create your own scenarios easily and fast.

You should be familiar with [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) (or Java) and Cucumber to create new scenarios and corresponding glue code.

This is a skeleton which is based on Selenium, Cucumber with Kotlin, and parallel-execution support with Cucable.
Also, [Cucumber Picocontainers](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/tree/master/picocontainer) were added for a smooth usage of test data among all steps.
For a quick and easy setup of Webdriver, [WebDriverManager](https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager) from [Boni Garcia](https://github.com/bonigarcia/bonigarcia.github.io) is used. 

Reports will be generated with [Cluecumber Report](https://github.com/trivago/cluecumber-report-plugin) or - if you run the test in a Jenkins environment - [Cucumber Report](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Cucumber+Reports+Plugin) can be used for smooth reports.


## Prerequisites
* Java SDK (recommended Version 15)
* Maven

### Optional
* If you do not want to run the test locally: Selenium Grid, [Selenoid](https://github.com/aerokube/selenoid) or Moon
* For Android test execution: [Appium](https://github.com/appium/appium)  


# How to run tests locally

* Option 1: Start with Maven

     `clean install -DbaseUrl=http://peso.inso.tuwien.ac.at -f pom.xml` 

* Option 2: Start directly from IDEA with a runConfiguration
![idea run configuration](docs/images/idea_runConfig.png)
Use the runConfiguration File which is located in the resources-folder and adapt the parameter for your need

In both cases you need to define some parameters to get the tests running:

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| baseUrl* | The base URL for your website under test. |
| browser | Choose the browser type. Allowed values are defined in [DriverTypes Class](src/test/kotlin/at.co.boris.secton/driverutil/DriverTypes.kt). default = chrome |
| browser.version | If you do not want to use the latest browser version, which is provided by the Webdriver manager, you can set the version with this parameter.|
| driver.version | Sometimes it is necessary to define the Webdriver version, depending on which browser.version you are using or is installed on your local machine. To define browser.version and driver.version use Boni Garcia's [WebDriverManager](https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager).|  
| screen | If running tests on a multi monitor system, this parameter will move the browser window to the specified screen ID. |
| printScreen | Gives you the ID's of connected screens in log for next run using the screen parameter |
| selenium.grid | URL of Selenium grid server or a service which implements the Selenium grid protocol like Selenoid or Appium. |
| device.id | only used if you want to run with mit mobile-chrome
\* is mandatory

### Run tests with Selenium grid, Selenoid or Appium

    -Dselenium.grid=http://<ip-of-your-grid:4444>

Example runtime parameters:

    -Dbrowser=chrome
    -Dbrowser.version=76.0
    -DbaseUrl="http://peso.inso.tuwien.ac.at"
    -Ddriver.version="76.0.3809.126"

# Scenarios
### Feature file structure
In order to find scenarios faster - especially if they fail - a scenario template with two components is used:
* Filename is given in "[ ]" (squared brackets)
* Description of every scenario starts with [XXX-99 followed again with the [filename]

example:


    Feature: [peso] Example Feature

      Background:
        Given the start page is loaded

      Scenario: [HWD-01 [peso]
        Then the peso logo should be displayed
      
      
[peso] means that "peso" is the filename. This makes it much easier to locate steps when IntelliJ Runner or Jenkins Cucumber report mark a scenario or step as failed.

Scenarios have a unique ID which you have to assign manually and keep track of. If a scenario fails, you can easily jump to the step definitions via text search in your IDE.

#Supported Browser in DriverType enum
Setup will be done via WebDriverManager as mentioned above.
### regular Browsers for local run
Chrome, Firefox, Opera, IE and Edge

### Remote Browsers (via Selenoid, Selenium Grid, ...)
Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Chrome Mobile, Chrome Mobile Emulation, Android

### Mobile Chrome emulation (with user agent manipulation)
Chrome is used with a manipulated user agent, similar to the mobile view in browser developer mode.
The following option is set in the DriverFactory: 
 `chromeOptions.setExperimentalOption("mobileEmulation", mobileEmulation);`

### Mobile-chrome (via Selenoid)
This only works if you have a Selenoid or Moon environment. For further information take a look at [Aerokube Website](https://aerokube.com) 

Example of a runtime configuration for an emulated Pixel 2 with a desktop Chrome browser:

    -Dbrowser=chrome_mobile_emulation
    -Dbrowser.version=75.0
    -Ddriver.version=75
    -DbaseUrl="http://peso.inso.tuwien.ac.at"
    -Demulated.device="Pixel 2"
    
### Android device (via Appium)
You can use an emulated device (AVD Manager) or a connected real device, which both have to be supported by Appium.


    boris@xps13:~/Android/Sdk/platform-tools$ ./adb devices
    List of devices attached
    emulator-5554	device

Use parameter to set the ID `-Ddevice.id="emulator-5554"`

Example of runtime configuration for running a test on a emulated Android device on Appium (which runs locally on Port 4723):

        -Dbrowser=appium_android_device
        -DbaseUrl="http://peso.inso.tuwien.ac.at"
        -Dselenium.grid=http://localhost:4723
        -Ddriver.version=2.34
        -Ddevice.id="emulator-5554"


# Troubleshooting
## IDEA Configuration

If the generated project does not compile or cannot be started from IDEA, check the Version of the JDK
Use an JDK Version from 12 to 15
